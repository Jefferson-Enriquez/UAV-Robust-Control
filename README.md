# Robust Control Using a H∞ Mixed Sensitivity Approach for a UAV with a Suspended Payload  
**ID**: 9285  

## 1. Description:  
- **linealSimu.m**: contains the script for the state-variable function with the UAV parameters.  
- **linealControl.m**: contains the script for the linearization of the original system, the creation of the extended plant, and the control.  
- **weighting**: contains the script to build the weighting functions.  
- **graphics.m**: contains the script to display the graphs of the “Weighting5” functions.  
- **PlantaUAV.slx**: contains the Simulink file of the original system described in “Lineal5simu.m.”  
- **ControlPlant.slx**: contains the Simulink file for applying control to the original system and the linearized system.
